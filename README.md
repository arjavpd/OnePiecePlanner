Hello My name is Arjav Praasad. This is the One Piece Planner. Users can create an account and create projects. What a great way to stay organized!
This Web App is themed around the popular manga "One Piece" of which I am a big fan! https://arjavpd.github.io/OnePiecePlanner

It is made using ReactJS. It also uses Materlize CSS for styling, Firebase authentication for sign-up/sign-in and Firestore database for back-end storage.

I used github pages to publish the site. It is how you are able to see the site. I used github extensively through this project for storage and 
hosting puposes. 

I first created a basic outline and plan for the application (attached below). Then I went to work creating the various components. Finnally I wrapped up with polishing and
styling. I scoured online for tutorials, guides, and forums whenever I was stuck. By the end of the project, I relized I had become more efficient at finding key 
information than I was at the beginning.

I really enjoyed making this application. I have learned a lot and am excited to learn new things by taking on new projects. 

Hope you enjoy taking a look around. 

You can email me with any questions at: arjavprasad@gmail.com 

Thank you! :)
